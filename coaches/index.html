              Mr. Will Baker is the Director of the NYU Global Debate Program
              (GDP) housed at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business. The GDP
              develops curricular & co-curricular programming for use at all
              global NYU sites and is the umbrella for NYU’s award-winning
              NDT/CEDA debate program. Baker’s competed for Cornell University

              season, Baker's squad qualified for the NDT, finished 3rd at
              Novice Nationals, finished 1st in Sweepstakes as the top debate
              program across all formats at the Big Tent Online Championships
              and won the CEDA National Public Debate Award for community

              debaters. In 2003, NYU captured the National Championship making
              Baker the first African American director to secure that title
