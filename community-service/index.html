          <p>
            NYU CEDA team members volunteer over 300 hours of community service
            each year to help administer the International Public Policy Forum
            (IPPF) with the Brewer Foundation. Founded in 2001, the IPPF is the
            only contest that gives high school students worldwide the
            opportunity to engage in written and oral debates on issues of
            public policy. Each year, the competition involves thousands of
            students from more than 200 high schools in more than 20 countries.
            The IPPF is administered by the Brewer Foundation and NYU, with the
            NYU CEDA team serving as judges, essay graders, school ambassadors,
            and facilitators for the event. With extensive help from the NYU
            team and the tremendous leadership of the Brewer Foundation, the
            IPPF is available to all public and private high schools across the
            globe for FREE.

          <h2>ABOUT THE BREWER FOUNDATION</h2>

          <p>
            Brewer, Attorneys &amp; Counselors is a litigation firm practicing
            in the field of complex commercial litigation and dispute
            resolution. The firm was co-founded in 1984 by William A. Brewer
            III, who has earned a national reputation as one of the most
            successful lawyers in the United States. The firm’s commitment to
            client advocacy is equaled only by its commitment to the community.
            Its engagement takes the form of both The Brewer Storefront—the
            firm’s pro bono community service affiliate—and The Brewer
            Foundation, which supports a broad range of community initiatives
            and educational programs. In addition to the IPPF, the Brewer
            Foundation funds and manages the Future Leaders Program (FLP), a
            public-private partnership that lights a path to college for
            deserving students from the Dallas Independent School. As the first
            program of its kind, the FLP has helped its students earn more than
            $17 million in scholarship offers since its inception. Founded in
            1995, the Brewer Storefront handles individual matters that often
            establish legal precedent and make a long-term, positive impact on
            the community at large. The Storefront has successfully resolved a
            number of Voting Rights Act cases that have secured voter equality,
            providing political opportunity for all.

            <p>
              Every year, members of the NYU CEDA team serve as &quot;NYU
              Ambassadors” to the final eight IPPF teams. One NYU student is
              paired with each team. The Ambassadors serve as mentors to the
              teams and share information about, among other things,
              participation in college debate.

            <h3>2022-23 ELITE EIGHT</h3>
            <p>
              The 2022-23 IPPF involved qualifying round submissions from more
              than 220 teams, representing schools in 22 countries and 31 U.S.
              states. Those essays were judged, with the help of the NYU CEDA
              team, and the top 64 teams were invited to engage in a
              single-elimination, written debate tournament. By April, the field
              was narrowed to the final eight teams, who were invited to compete
              in oral debates in New York City. Here are the results of those
              debates.

          <p>
            How Do Students Learn &mdash; First, a cohort of graduate students
            from New York University’s Foundations of Learning Science course
            taught by Professor Alyson Wyse selected numerous novices and junior
            varsity CEDA debaters to conduct interviews, observe practice rounds
            and attend tournaments over the course of the year virtually and
            in-person using a constructivism lens. The trio of researchers
            examined knowledge production and training strategies to draw
            conclusions about how learners learn.
          </p>

          <p>
            Creating Models for Better Judgements &mdash; CEDA debaters
            volunteered for a postdoctoral research initiative run by the Center
            for Data Science to build machine learning models that debate each
            other as a way of helping people make better judgments on hard
            decisions. Students assisted with data collection, testing and
            brainstorming sessions to help determine factors in establishing
            controlled settings.
